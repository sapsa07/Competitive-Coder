1. **01 Knapsack**
   1. Recursive
   2. Dynamic - Memoization
   3. Dynamic - Top Down DP
   4. **Types of Problem**
      1. Subset Sum Problem
      2. Equal Sum Partition Problem
      3. Count of Subsets Sum with a  Given Sum
      4. Minimum Subset Sum Difference
      5. Count the number of subset with  given difference
      6. Target Sum
      7. Unbounded Knapsack
      8. Rod Cutting Problem
      9. Coin Change Problem: Maximum number of ways
   
2. **Kadane's Algorithm**

   **About the problem - : -**

   Also known as **Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray**  to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a 1D array of numbers which has the largest sum.

   arr[ ] = -2 -3 4 -1 -2 1 5 -3

   **Maximum Contiguous Array Sum is : 4 + (-1) + (-2) + 1 + 5 = 7**

   **Idea : ** To Look for all positive contiguous segment of the array.







#### String Problems

1. #### KMP Algorithm for Pattern Searching

   Given a text *txt[0..n-1]* and a pattern *pat[0..m-1]*, write a function that prints all occurrences of *pat[]* in *txt[]*. You may assume that *n > m*.
