### 										Dynamic Programming

Top 50 common data structure problems that can be solved using Dynamic programming  :

1. [Longest Common Subsequence | Introduction & LCS Length](https://www.techiedelight.com/longest-common-subsequence/)

   The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence that is present in given two sequences in the same order. i.e. find a longest sequence which can be obtained from the first original sequence by deleting some items, and from the second original sequence by deleting other items.

   The problem differs from problem of finding common substrings. Unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

   Ex : X: ABCBDAB

   ​	   Y: BDCABA

   ​		The length of LCS is 4

   ​		LCS are BDAB, BCAB and BCBA

   Naive Solution : O(n.2^m)
